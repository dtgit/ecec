Remaining bugs
==============
(most important first)



Other changes needed
====================

  LinguaPlone changes:

 - No Cancel button on split screen translation form
   --> deo: this will be achieved only when the addTranslation method becomes
            portal_factory-aware.

 - Pending translations managed using worklists, workflow script to mail
   maintainers with diff of changes in canonical version.

 - AUTO_NOTIFY_CANONICAL_UPDATE - it's accessible only in the config.py, a way
   to set the value through the web is better so we can manage the plone
   instance behavior.

 - When translating a folder and copying over already translated subobjects,
   chop off the -languagecode appendix of the id of the translated objects.


  Plone changes

  - Members folder should really be a special content type, since it's not
    contentish. If you translate it at the moment, you get all sorts of strange
    side effects. :)

Documentation
=============

  - Write "Content Language Fallback Considered Harmful" document to avoid
    getting silly patches and add-on products that try to do things you
    shouldn't do. Also for consultants to give to their customers.


Archetypes changes
==================

  - Enable language aware references tool to enable linking to canonical and
    retrieval of correct translation (this has to be fixed in Archetypes).


Additional notes
================

  - LanguageIndependent fields doesn't work on password fields, since the
    widget is empty by default. This is certainly a rarely occuring problem
    (could happen with things like Membrane and CMFMember), but should probably
    be investigated.

  - The ideal approach is to delete all translations when you do a delete
    operation in the canonical, but it's not implemented. For now, you can
    remove individual translations with the Manage Translations menu item
    on the objects themselves.

  Some cases:

  If you move content between folders, you'd expect that translations are
  moved between corresponding translated folders. What if you're moving to a
  folder that isn't translated yet. Everything could be moved into the
  untranslated folder, but then you'd need id resolution.

  Can you only move the original content (canonical translation), or can you
  move translations? Technically it's not a problem to have different
  hierarchies in the different languages as it's all done by references, but
  it might not desirable.

  When you paste, you might get id conflicts. These are typically resolved by
  'copy of id', but it's not obvious what happened to the ids of the copied
  translations until you check the screen later. And there is no easy way of
  easily changing all ids. Maybe we should change all translation ids that
  are the same as the id of the canonical translation when renaming the
  canonical translation.

  There are probably more gotchas that would have to be worked out.
