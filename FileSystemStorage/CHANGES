####

  * Run unit tests with Zope 2.7 and Plone 2.0

  * Add checksum to be sure files are not corrupted on filesystem

  * Include Czek translation expected from Radim

  * Fix screenshot (deprecated from 2.6)

2.6.2 - 2007/12/07
##################

  * correct traitment of range header : if one range - specific file stream iterator
  if multiple range - OFS.image traitment (1680760 sourceforge tracker)
  Add some unit test to test range header

2.6.1 - 2007/10/29
##################

  * ZConfig bug that put all config sting in lowercase: we test path in lowercase too (ED)

  * Remove the OSError when moving file into backup

  * Plone 3.0 compatibility (GL)

  * Do not override Content-Disposition HTTP header if already set in VirtualBinary.index_html (zegor)

  * filestream_iterator is not "range proof". Add a new range_filestream_iterator to negociate Range request

2.6.0 RC1 - 2007/06/15
######################

  * Changed in depth the way we configure FSS with the ZConfig
    way. Changing the storage and backup path, and the storage
    strategy TTW is disabled (GL)

  * As a consequence, changing the storage strategy doesn't require to
    hack config.py any more (GL)

  * As a consequence, each Plone site in a Zope instance can have its
    own storage strategy (GL)

  * Configuration view and README.txt view in ZMI (GL)

  * Fixed documentation issues (GL)

  * SiteStorageStrategy and SiteStorageStrategy2 didn't work under
    Win32 (GL)

  * Make FSS compatible with Plone 2.0 : just rewrite some testcases

2.5.6 - 2007/06/15
##################

  * When renaming a folder containing FSS content, FSSInfo attribute was
    stolen one each content of the folder. Provides a solution to avoid this
    problem (CL)

2.5.5 - 2007/06/13
##################

  * Make FSS works when calling _setUID method on an AT object (CL)

  * Add a strategy mark in the storage in a '.strategy' file such we
    could forbid strategy changes of storages at Zope startup. (i.e.,
    using a 'flat' storage strategy in a storage filled using a
    'directory' strategy)

2.5.4 - 2007/03/13
##################

  * Fix a bug on Plone 2.5 when moving a folder containing items using
    FSS storage. Those items were losing their FSS content. (CL)

2.5.3 - 2007/02/12
##################

  * Don't monkey patch BaseObject __bobo_traverse__ under Plone 2.5, but
    register ITraversable adapter for this. This change is required as of
    Archetypes 1.4.1 (see AT HISTORY.txt, search '__bobo_traverse__')

2.5.2 - 2006/10/27
##################

  * Fix bug on maintenance tab: update files and backup, and update RDF (ED)

  * Fix some renaming bugs (ED)

  * Extend index_html method of VirtualFile and VirtualImage to use a
    filestream iterator. FSS is now compliant with CacheFu

  * Fix bug in FSSTool:updateFSS - replace restoreBackup method by
    restoreValueFile

  * Add new strategy: SiteStorageStrategy2

2.5.1 - 2006/07/28
##################

  * Check existence of backup and storage paths in configlet

  * Fix bug on maintenance tab

  * Add storage strategies : FlatStorageStrategy,
    DirectoryStorageStrategy, \ SiteStorageStrategy

  * Patch BaseObject to make it possible to access images like this
    mysite/myobj/image or mysite/myobj/image_mini

  * Added a docstring on VirtualData class and subclasses. This should
    fix http://plone.org/products/atphoto/issues/28 : VirtualImage can
    be published directly by ATImage
