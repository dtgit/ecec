#
# ===========================================================
#
# Please do not change this file since this is the default
# configuration file and this file is used in the unit tests. Follow
# the instructions in README.txt to override the default settings
# found in this file.
#
# These are the default instance wide values all Plone instances will
# use unless their setting is overriden by a <plone-site ...>
# subsection for individual Plone sites.
#
# Note that all environment variables are available here to your
# convenience. These must be prefixed with "$$" (as $$HOME,
# $$ZOPE_HOME, $$INSTANCE_HOME, $$CLIENT_HOME, ...)
#
# Refreshing FSS through the ZMI may or may not take into account the
# settings changed here. Restarting Zope will always reload this
# configuration file (unless it has errors).
#
# ===========================================================
#
# Give the absolute path where your files will be stored in the
# `storage-path` value. This path **must** be created, and the user
# that runs the Zope process (see `effective-user` in `zope.conf`)
# **must** have the read + write + delete permissions in this
# path. See your operating system documentation.
#
# Examples:
# storage-path /home/zope/instance/fss_files
# storage-path C:\zope\instance\fss_files
#
# Default: $$INSTANCE_HOME/var/fss_storage

# storage-path $$INSTANCE_HOME/var/fss_files

# ===========================================================
#
# Give the absolute path where deleted files of deleted content will
# go (Undo support) in the `backup-path` value. The same rules as the
# ones for the `path` value apply here (existence, read/write/delete
# permissions). In addition, `path` and `backup-path` must be
# different.
#
# Examples:
# backup-path /home/zope/instance/fss_backup
# packup-path C:\zope\instance\fss_backup
#
# Default: $$INSTANCE_HOME/var/fss_backup

# backup-path $$INSTANCE_HOME/var/fss_backup

# ===========================================================
#
# Give your preferred global storage strategy in the storage-strategy`
# value. The following values are available:
#
# * `flat`: see "Flat storage strategy" in README.txt.
# * `directory` : see "Directory storage strategy" in README.txt.
# * `site1`: see "Site storage strategy 1" in README.txt
# * `site2`: see "Site storage strategy 2" in README.txt

# Examples:
# storage-strategy directory
#
# Default: flat

# storage-strategy flat

# ===========================================================
#
# <site /my/plone>

  # The optional settings here override the global FSS configuration
  # in the above section for the Plone site in the `/my/plone` Zope
  # path. You may add ass many <site ...> sections as needed.

  # `storage-path` for this site
  
  # Example: storage-path $$INSTANCE_HOME/var/my_plone/fss

  # `backup-path` for this site

  # Example: backup-path $$INSTANCE_HOME/var/my_plone/fss_backup

  # Override above described `storage-strategy`.

  # Example: storage-strategy site1

# </site>

# <site /other/plone>
  # ...
# </site>
