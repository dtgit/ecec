========================
Changes in version 3.1.0
========================

"Download Course" Additions 
   Moved "download this course" into a "Reuse Course" portlet. The course downloads now include IMS information. Using a portlet will also allow for additional formats, such as Common Cartridge, to be added in the future.  

Display License and Caption for Embedded Objects 
   Using the Kupu editor, eduCommons can now display separate licenses and citations for image objects embedded in a page, distinct from the overall page license. 

Captcha integration 
   We now integrate captcha on the registration page to prevent spambot submissions.

Lingua Plone 2.0 Integration 
   LinguaPlone 2.0 has been implemented into eduCommons 3.1.0, allowing users to localize content and support multiple languages on a single OpenCourseWare site. 

Add accessibility check 
   This is intended to help institutions who want to include accessibility check into their workflow. 

Enable Javascript/Page-specific CSS and embed tags by default
   We have enabled Javascript and page-specific CSS and embed tags by default.

Documentation for Adding Small Widgets 
   Add eduCommons-specific documentation and examples for adding Plone 3 portlets. 

Add "Remix this course" functionality 
   This feature is designed to allow courses from MIT OpenCourseWare (pending implementation by MIT OCW) as well as other eduCommons OCWs to be easily imported into OpenOCW (or another eduCommons site if specified, but OpenOCW will be the default). On published eduCommons OCW courses that have been packaged, a "Remix this course" link appears. This allows unauthenticated users to send the entire course to OpenOCW (OpenOCW login credentials must be provided).  

Update "download this course" to improve handling of large courses 
   "Download this course" is no longer auto-generated when a course is published or changed. Instead, a new "Package course" button appears in the contents view of the course once it has been published. The "Download this course" .zip file now includes IMS information. It now appears in its own portlet, along with the "Remix this course" link.

Other updates
   Updated eduCommons to exclude new content from showing in the left nav by default (including zip imports).
   Improved IE 6 and 7 compatibility.

  tags missing in the manifest file, if it is not able to read it directly.

  This version ships with detailed documentation on how to write out an IMS 
  Content Package that eduCommons can consume. The documentation is provided
  in raw text, web based, and in a standalone (PDF) file.

A New Content Licensing Engine
  eduCommons now allows a default content license and a rights holder to be
  set sitewide. It also includes the ability to license an individual piece 
  of content, should the need arise to publish content under a license 
  different to the site wide one.

Copyright Bylines
  Content is now published with the appropriate copyright byline, including
  the ability to specify copyright dates, the rights holder, and the license
  itself. The license includes a hyper-link to the legal terms of the license
  as well as an icon (if the license includes one).

  eduCommons now includes a license selector that integrates with Creative
  Commons Licenses (www.creativecommons.org), allowing eduCommons to remain
  flexible with the latest CC offerings.

Support for Other Licenses
  eduCommons supports other licenses, including the traditional all rights 
  reserved, and GNU Free Document Licenses, as well as allowing content
  developers to input their own license.

RDF and machine readable Creative Commons License Support
  eduCommons will publish by default any metadata for a content object in
  embedded RDF format. eduCommons will also publish machine readable creative
  commons licenses, that can be read and processed by search engines.

Content Licensing Product for Plone 2.5
  The content licensing features in eduCommons are shipped in a standalone product
  that can also be used in a default Plone 2.5 instance.

Native Support for Plone 2.5
  This version of eduCommons supports the latest version of Plone (2.5), with some 
  functionality now taking advantage of the new Zope 3 component architecture.

==============================
Changes in version 2.0.0-final
==============================

Human Readable URLS

Recursive Folder Change State
  Can change workflow state recursively on content in subfolders.

Native Support for Plone 2.1
  Integrated eduCommons custom skin files with new Plone 2.1 functionality. 
  Content objects are now based on ATContentTypes. Substantial changes across 
  the code base. eduCommons is currently based on Plone-2.1.2 and Zope-2.8.6.

Content Status History on Object Views in Edit Mode
  The content status history of an object is now available in the view from 
  a history link at the top of the page while in edit mode.

No Redirect on Front Page
  Front page no longer redirects to an ECIndex folder, but renders directly.

Removed Forum Support
  Forum support is being replaced by new social software in the future, which 
  means that the old OLS code base is no longer being maintained. If you require 
  forum support it is recommended that you use the excellent zForum 
  (http://www.zforum.org) plone product until the new software is in place.

Improved IMS Content packaging
  Workflow status history is now written in the IMS content package instead 
  of being stored in a binary blob.

  eduCommons site title, making it easier to customize default site text.

Support for Default Templates
  Support for adding default templates for commonly used pages within eduCommons.


Review and Revise IMS Export Rights
  Changes in the UI to only present IMS import/export to administrators and managers. 
  This is necessary because producers do not have rights on content that is not in the 
  "In Progress" state, which prevents producers from being able to import/export 
  content not in the appropriate state. 


Zip export (non-ims)
  Allow a producer administrator or manager to export course content in a zip file format.

Creative Commons metadata header
  Add a metadata header to ECDocuments for the creative commons license.

  Adding the ability to do validation of XHTML across a course, while reporting 
  errors in a log file.

  objects will retain their links with out having to rewrite them.
