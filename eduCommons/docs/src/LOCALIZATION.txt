LinguaPlone Translation Instructions
====================================

In the context of Department, Course, and ECObjects, translations must occur in a 'top down'
manner.  A Department must be translated prior to translating a Course, which must be
translated prior to any objects in the Course being translated.

By default, LinguaPlone will tag newly created content objects in the default language setting 
for the instance. Objects that exist in the ZODB prior to LinguaPlone being installed will be 
'neutral', in terms of their language setting. In order to maintain the correct relationships 
between languages, existing objects must have their language 'set'. 

To set an existing object's language, click translate into on the management toolbar, and then 
click manage translations.... This interface will allow you to change the content language 
setting from neutral to the appropriate setting for your instance.

Localization with eduCommons $$version$$
========================================

Overview
--------
If you want to translate eduCommons into your language, here are instructions on how to get 
started, as well as some guidelines that you should follow when performing a translation. You do
not need to know anything about programming to create an eduCommons translation. This 
has been adapted for eduCommons from the `plone translator guidelines 
<http://plone.org/development/teams/i18n/translators-guidelines>`__. Please see our `eduCommons
Localization Team page <./educommons-localization-team>`__ for a list of our volunteer translators.

Introduction
------------
Since eduCommons is customized from Plone, it has built-in support for internationalization. As of 
June 2006 Plone has 56 different translations. eduCommons requires some additional 
translation work, but follows the same process as Plone. Adding an eduCommons translation is much 
less time consuming because most of the translation work has already been done in Plone.

There are about 400 strings needed for a translation of eduCommons (compared to about 1600 strings 
for a Plone translation). Some of these are sentences or paragraphs, but the major part are one or 
two words. These strings are scattered around in Plone, for example in page templates. Other items 
to translate are widget labels, and workflow states. All those strings are collected in master 
files. Currently eduCommons contains six .pot files. Each language requires its own .po files that
corresponds to the strings or message ids declared in the .pot files. The .pot is the blueprint for
the .po files.


Tools
-----
When creating the .po files, we strongly recommend using a specialized tool called poEdit 
(http://www.poedit.net). This makes the translation process very easy. But a normal 
text editor work fine if you prefer that (both vim and emacs are great for this, and have special 
modes for PO files). poEdit exists for both Linux and Windows, and Mac OS X.

If you use a plain text editor instead of a dedicated tool, you should make sure you use utf-8 
as your charset, even if your country usually uses iso-8859-* or similar. The reason for this is 
that Plone uses a few characters (like the ellipsis) that don't have representations in other 
charsets.


Step-by-step guide
------------------
    1. Check if somebody is working on your language already. Even if they do, contact them and 
    offer to help with testing. There's no way the eduCommons team can know what is a high-quality 
    translation in a language they don't know, so your input is very valuable to us. We want 
    good translations, not just a translation. So if you think something is badly done, tell us. 
    Give polite feedback if something feels wrong with the translation to your language. A 
    translation can always be made better.
    
    2. Be sure that you have used eduCommons enough to grasp the general concepts and how they 
    interact. eduCommons is an advanced system, so be sure you know enough before you start 
    translating key concepts like workflow. Check the language specific terms for your language, 
    or create one if it doesn't exist. This will help you keep consistent translations for your 
    language.
    
    3. Download the files to base your translation on. We recommend that you always use the 
    English language files as your starting point, both because they are always the most current 
    ones (other translations will usually lag a bit behind), and because you should try to match 
    the original text. Translating between similar languages may be tempting (like Danish and 
    Norwegian), but will usually result in a lower quality translation. Of course, if the only 
    language you understand is Italian, and you want to provide a Chinese translation, we prefer 
    this translation compared to not getting one at all :)
    
    4. Here is a link to the most recent translation files available for eduCommons (plone.po and 
    eduCommons.po). Remember, unless there is already an existing translation available, you need 
    to grab the .pot files.

	Here are links to the latest translations for each of the eduCommons products on the Plone 
	Collective site (these links may change, so check back for the most accurate information):

    5. Open poEdit or your editor of choice and load the first of the master files. In poEdit 
    select File --> Open (for existing .po translation files) or File --> New catalog from POT file. 
    (to create a new translation from a .pot file). Be sure to set the language and language code in 
    Catalog --> Settings. With poEdit or other editors you will need to save your new translation files 
    as <product>-<language-code>.po (e.g. for a French translation: plone-fr.po, eduCommons-fr.po, etc). 
    Have a look at http://www.i18nguy.com for the correct language code.

    6. In poEdit, the first line shows the exact string that you have to translate. Your translation is 
    entered in the area below the original string. It's easy. This is why we recommend poEdit.
    
    7. In other text editors things will look a little different. An example section can look like this:

      |   #. Default: "Export"
      |	  #: ../skins/eduCommons/Export_form.cpt
      |	  msgid "Export"
      |	  msgstr ""
      |
      
      The first line (marked with Default) shows the exact string that you have to translate. 
      Message attributes in the form ${foo} have to be included in the translated string exactly 
      as they are. These are variables that will be filled in the rendering process. Do not touch 
      this.
    
      The next lines (marked with :) list which templates inside eduCommons use this string. There 
      might be several templates re-using the same string, but it is normally in the same context. 
      Do not touch this.
    
      The next to last line (starting with msgid) holds the unique identifier for the string. Do 
      not touch this.
    
      Finally, the last line is where your job starts. Enter the text in your language, be careful 
      to keep the same casing (where appropriate, some languages have different rules that should 
      be applied).
    
    8. If there is programming code in a string, only translate the string, not the code. For example in, 
    Default: "${number} items matching your criteria." you would only translate "items matching your 
    criteria." The code in the first part should be left as it is, so the translation will look like this:  
    ${number} TRANSLATION.

    9. Keep translating (but take breaks, this isn't done in one sitting - it's repetetive (but 
    rewarding) work. After you have translated all of plone.pot, you should start on eduCommons.pot. 
    Don't worry, you have already completed the biggest part.
    
    10. If you can, test your files. Get other people from your own country to test. This means having other 
    people check your file and putting your file in an eduCommons test instance, browsing it in 
    your language.
    
    11. If you are unsure about the best translation of a message, you can set it to fuzzy, so 
    others can look at these. Setting a message to fuzzy means adding a "#, fuzzy"-line directly 
    above the line starting with msgid (poEdit has a button for this).
    
    12. Since some of the translation files are hosted on the Plone Collective, if you know how SVN
    works, you can get an account with Plone (Here's how to request write access to the Collective.)
    and maintain the files in SVN yourself (see next section). If not, no problem, just e-mail your
    translation to us at eduCommons [at] cosl [dot] usu [dot] edu, and we will add it for you and put it into the
    eduCommons distribution in the next release. We will also add you to our our `eduCommons
    Localization Team page. <./educommons-localization-team>`__
    
    13. Please check on your translations periodically to keep them updated as new versions are 
    released. A quick find for "" will reveal any new or missing stings that need to be translated.
    
    14. If you have other questions or about contributing a translation to eduCommons please contact
    us at educommons [at] cosl [dot] usu [dot] edu. Thank you for you help!
