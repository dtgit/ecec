"""eduCommons is server software designed to provide last-mile support for open

Many institutions already deliver digital educational materials via a closed access 
learning management system like WebCT or Blackboard. With this existing collection 
of digitized educational materials, such an institution is very close to being 
able to launch its own open access collection initiative. eduCommons begins here, 
providing the remaining functionality necessary to successfully develop and 
manage the collection, including a workflow process that steps users through 
uploading materials into the repository, the copyright clearance process, 
reassembly of materials into courses, a quality assurance process, and final 
publication of the materials. Powered by Python, Zope, and Plone, eduCommons 
is open source software that runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows platforms."""
