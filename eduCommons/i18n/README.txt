eduCommons Internationalization

Since eduCommons is customized from Plone, it has built-in support for internationalization. As of June 2006 Plone is available in 56 different translations. eduCommons requires some additional translation work, but follows the same process as Plone. Adding an eduCommons translation is usually less time consuming because much of the tranlation work has already been done in Plone. Documentation for translating eduCommons is available here: http://cosl.usu.edu/projects/educommons/documentation/how-to/localizing-educommons

If you have questions or are interested in contributing a translation to eduCommons please contact us at educommons@cosl.usu.edu. Thanks!
