<h2 tal:content="string:About ${portal_title} OCW">About eduCommons</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3><a id="q1" name="q1"></a> What is <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OpenCourseWare?</h3>

<p>The idea behind <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is to make <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> course materials that are used
in the teaching of undergraduate and graduate subjects available on the
Web, free of charge, to any user anywhere in the world. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW will
advance technology-enhanced education at <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block>, and will serve as a model
for university dissemination of knowledge in the Internet age. This
venture continues the tradition at <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block>, and in American higher
education, of open dissemination of educational materials, philosophy,
and modes of thought, and will help lead to fundamental changes in the
way colleges and universities utilize the Web as a vehicle for
education.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>


<li><h3><a id="q2" name="q2"></a> Why is <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> doing this?</h3>

<p>Because technology makes it possible for us to increase the reach of
educational opportunity, we have a moral obligation to do so. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW
supports <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block>'s mission to serve the public through learning, discovery,
and engagement, and is true to <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block>'s guiding principle that academics
come first. As <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> enters the 21st century, services like
OpenCourseWare enable it to more fully accomplish its land grant
mission. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW contributes to the "shared intellectual commons" in
academia, which fosters collaboration across <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> and among other
scholars across disciplines and around the world.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>


<li><h3><a id="q3" name="q3"></a> How does <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW differ from other types of Web-based education, including distance learning?</h3>

<p><tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW differs from other <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> Web-based education offerings in that it
is free and open, does not provide university credit, and grants no
access to university faculty. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is not a distance-learning
initiative. Distance learning involves the active exchange of
information between faculty and students, with the goal of obtaining
some form of a credential. Increasingly, distance learning is also
limited to those willing and able to pay for materials or course
delivery. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is not meant to replace degree-granting higher
education or for-credit courses. Rather, the goal is to provide the
content that supports an education.</p>

<p>Many individual faculty members at <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> and other universities
already use the Web extensively to make standard course materials
available to their students. Some colleges and universities now require
a Web site for every class. But, to a large extent, these Web sites are
designed for, and access is only provided to, the students enrolled at
these institutions. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is an unprecedented effort of a much
broader magnitude, as the goal is to provide the course materials free
and open to the world.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>


<li><h3><a id="q4" name="q4"></a> What are the long-term goals of the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW initiative?</h3>

<p>We expect <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW to grow to encompass the course materials of all
faculty who are willing to participate. Over time, the goal is for most
of the courses offered at <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> to be represented in the collection.
Another goal of <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is to catalyze the development of groups or
communities around the course materials. Individuals participating in
these informal groups will coach, mentor, and support each other in
their learning, adding significant value to the materials themselves.
Finally, we strongly desire to extend the reach and impact of the
"opencourseware" concept.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>


<li><h3><a id="q5" name="q5"></a> Will <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW always be free and openly available to anyone in the world?</h3>

<p>We are committed to <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW remaining a free and openly available
publication of the course materials that support the dynamic classroom
interactions of a <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> education. Even as we continue to grow and
evolve, the materials will always remain free and open to all. Along
with this commitment to remaining free and open, <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is also
committed to the idea that <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is not a distance-learning, or a
degree-granting, initiative, and that there will not be a registration
process required for users to view course materials now or in the
future. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is working hard to publish all of the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> faculty's
course materials who wish to participate.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<ol>

<li><h3><a id="q16" name="q16"></a> Why is there such variation in the breadth and depth of content presented on individual <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW course Web sites?</h3>

<p>Each <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW course Web site is developed individually with the
participating faculty and instructors. It includes as much of the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block>
faculty member's course materials as is available in a digital format,
or can be cost-effectively prepared; and is free of Intellectual
Property and copyright restrictions. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> faculty and instructors
participate only voluntarily, and publish only as much content as they
are comfortable having on a Web site that is freely accessible
worldwide.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>


<li><h3><a id="q17" name="q17"></a> Why do some <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW course sites lack solutions to assignments, quizzes, and exams?</h3>
<p>In some cases, solutions to homework assignments, quizzes, and exams
are only discussed and presented in the classroom, and not made
available in print or electronic format to the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> students--or to the
worldwide community of visitors to the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW Web site. In other
cases, the instructors plan to re-use in their <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> classroom the
assignments, quizzes, and exams, and so they do not wish to widely
publish their solutions.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>


<li><h3><a id="q18" name="q18"></a> Why doesn't every <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW course offer video lectures?</h3>
<p>Although video lectures are useful for students, there are many reasons
that <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW does not include video lectures in every course. First is
the issue of bandwidth. We are very much focused on making <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block>'s
courses materials as accessible as possible to users all over the
world, including the developing world. If we were to start depending on
the video component as THE key element of every <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW course, we
would be excluding a large portion of the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW audience who are
not using high-speed Internet  connections. They would never be able to
download the videos and we are very sensitive to that fact.</p>

<p>Another key concern about video is cost. The technology for
compressing and storing video becomes more and more affordable by the
day, but it is still not affordable, or feasible from a production
standpoint, for us to be compressing 20 video lectures for all of our
courses. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW does not have that kind of storage capacity, at this
time.</p>

<p>A key <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW audience is educators, and for them, we are hoping
that by providing the syllabus, reading lists and lecture notes, we are
offering a chance for them to jumpstart their own pedagogy and improve
the way they teach their chosen discipline. While video lectures are
very easy for people with fast Internet connections to watch, they do
not really fulfill the mission of <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW.</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<ol>

<li><h3><a id="q19" name="q19"></a> Who owns the intellectual property published on the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW Web site?</h3>

<p>Prior to making any course materials publicly available, the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW
team has reviewed all material extensively to determine the correct
ownership of the material and obtain the appropriate licenses to make
the material openly available on the Web. We will promptly remove any
material that is determined to be infringing on the rights of others [See also <a href="#q24">What do I do if I believe a portion of 
<tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW material infringes my copyright?</a>].</p>

<p>The intellectual property policies created for <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW are clear and
consistent with other policies for scholarly materials used in
education. Faculty retain ownership of most materials prepared for <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW. 
<tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> retains ownership only when significant use has been made of
the Institute's resources. If student course work is placed on the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW

<p>The intent of <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is that our Web site should reflect the course
materials for what is being taught at <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block>. The reason for this policy

members of the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> Faculty, and thus, our faculty will take final
responsibility for these materials. It would be difficult for <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW
to guarantee the accuracy and originality of materials we received from
outside sources. However, we encourage other universities to create
their own "opencourseware" in which materials from their courses would
be posted online and openly shared with the world. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is eager to
link to other universities or institutions that have similar goals.</p>

<p><tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW is intended as a publication of <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> course materials on the
Web, and not as an interactive experience with <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> faculty. It provides
the content of, but is not a substitute for, an <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> education. The most
fundamental cornerstone of the learning process at <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> is the
interaction between faculty and students in the classroom, and among
students themselves on campus. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW does not offer visitors to the
Web site the opportunity for direct contact with <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> faculty, though individual 
portal faculty may choose to list their contact information. Inquiries related to specific course materials will be forwarded 
to the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block>
faculty member associated with that course for their consideration.
However, due to the tremendous volume of email inquiries received, it
is unlikely he or she will answer all emails.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>


<li><h3><a id="q28" name="q28"></a> Will inquiries to <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW be answered?</h3>

<p>Yes inquiries will be answered. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW encourages users to provide <a href="../feedback">feedback</a> on the site and the
published course materials. The comments and constructive criticism of
users will help the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW staff improve the site and published course materials as we continue to evolve.</p>

<h2>Translations</h2>
<ol>

<li><h3><a id="q29" name="q29"></a> Can I translate the course materials in <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW?</h3>

<p>You may translate course materials in <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW if permitted by the license of the course materials you wish to translate. <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> asks that any <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW materials translated into other
languages from the original language must be accompanied by the proper attribution of the original materials and include the following disclaimer:</p>

<blockquote>"These <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OpenCourseWare course materials have

<h2>Usability</h2>
<ol>

<li><h3><a id="q30" name="q30"></a> What are the technical requirements for viewing <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW course materials?</h3>

<p>The majority of <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW course sites work in modern Web browsers on both the Macintosh and
Windows platforms. Although higher-speed connections are preferable,
slower connections, such as modems, should allow users to view most
materials on the sites (however, downloading or accessing materials may take
somewhat longer). <!--<tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW has tested the course sites with Netscape
version 4.75 and Internet Explorer version 5.5 browsers.--></p>

<p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>


<li><h3><a id="q31" name="q31"></a> What is metadata and why is it important to <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW?</h3>

<p>Metadata is, literally, "data about data." Metadata can be better
understood as information that describes other information. For
example, this Web page of FAQs for <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW has an author, a title, a
date of creation, and a unique Internet address; this information
constitutes the metadata about this page. Metadata enables
sophisticated, powerful, and accurate searches across <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW course
materials.</p>

<p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>


<li><h3><a id="q32" name="q32"></a> How do I change the font-size on the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW Web site?</h3>

<p>The fonts and style of the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW Web site have been specifically
selected to meet certain design and accessibility standards. The <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW 
Team has tested the site and these standards across a wide variety
of browsers and platform. However, some users may still find that their
browser configurations continue to display the text too small. You can
change the displayed font size using your browser's View menu. In
Netscape 7, there is a "VIEW - Text-Zoom" selection (try 120%). In
Netscape 4.x, there is a "VIEW - Increase Font" selection. In Internet
Explorer, you can select "VIEW - Text-Size - Larger or Largest." We
hope this helps you to more comfortably view the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW course
materials.</p>

<li><h3><a id="q33" name="q33"></a> Will the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW Web site be compliant with W3C standards and accessibility requirements?</h3>

<p>All course materials published on the <tal:block tal:replace="portal_title">eduCommons</tal:block> OCW site are checked to see if they are
valid XHTML and meet Section 508 and WAI-AA guidelines as part of the
authoring process. We require all images to contain ALT attributes and
all links to contain TITLE tags.</p>
